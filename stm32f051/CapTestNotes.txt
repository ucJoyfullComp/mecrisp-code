Pin PB2 driver for the resistor (100K - callibrated measure was 99.35 kohm)
Pin PB1 friver for quick charge and discharge of the capacitor - connected to
  resistor 330-510 ohm (over 100 times quicker charge, discharge)
Pin PA1 input connected to capacitor via current limiting resistor, in case of bug
  and connection of the pin as output, and the inputs of the window comparator.
Pin A6, A7 are output for debug purposes


Operation
 * PB2 driver High and Low at a rate slower than 99% charge of the capacitor
    every time the charge on the capacitor discharged less than 90% (0.33V)
    the rate of discharge is increased at least 100 fold by discharging via
    pin PB1 and a resistor of 470-330 ohm.
 * Pin PA1 connected as input of the two comparators in window configuration.
    The comparators are set to generate events on change. These events are
    routed to trigger input capture of timer IC4, and simultaneously interrupt
    request to the EXTI block. The interrupt handling routines for the comparators
    are to read the contents of the capture register
